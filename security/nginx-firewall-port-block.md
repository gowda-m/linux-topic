✅ Step 1 — Verify Nginx Service
systemctl status nginx


✅ Step 2 — Check Listening Port
ss -tulnp | grep nginx

Example output:

![service_running](security/Images/service_running.png)

![service_running](security/Images/service_running.png)

👉 Confirms nginx is working locally.

✅ Step 3 — Test Locally
curl localhost:8080

If response comes → nginx OK.


🔴 Step 4 — Check Firewall (Root Cause)
firewall-cmd --list-ports

**Port 8080/tcp not listed → blocked by firewalld.**

✅ Step 5 — Allow Port in Firewall
firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Verify:

firewall-cmd --list-ports

Output:

8080/tcp
✅ Step 6 — Test Again from Browser

Open:

http://server-ip:8080

✅ Website loads successfully.

✅ Step 7 — SELinux Check (If Still Not Working)

Check mode:

getenforce

If using custom port:

semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080
