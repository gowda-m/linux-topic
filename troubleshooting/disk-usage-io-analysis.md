📊 Disk Usage & IO Analysis (Linux)
What is Disk Usage?

Disk usage refers to how storage space is consumed by files, directories, logs, applications, and system data.

High disk usage may cause:

Application failures

System slowness

Log write failures

Service crashes

🔹 Check Disk Space
View filesystem usage
df -h

🔹 Find Large Directories

Check directory size:

du -sh *

Disk Usage Meaning
Field	Meaning
Size	Total disk size
Used	Consumed space
Avail	Free space
Use%	Disk utilization

Shows folder-wise usage in current directory.

Sort directories by size
du -sh * | sort -hr


Largest directories appear first.

🔹 Find Large Files

Files larger than 1GB:

find / -type f -size +1G 2>/dev/null


Useful when disk suddenly becomes full.

🔹 Check Top Disk Consumers
du -ah / | sort -rh | head -20


Shows top 20 largest files/directories.

🔹 Interactive Disk Analyzer (Recommended)

Install:

yum install ncdu -y


Run:

ncdu /


 Easy navigation
 Fast disk investigation

💽 Disk IO (Input / Output)

Disk IO measures read/write operations happening on disk.

High IO causes:

System lag

Slow applications

Database delays

🔹 Check Disk IO Usage
Install required package
yum install sysstat -y

Run:
iostat -x 1

Important fields
Field	Meaning
%util	Disk busy percentage
await	IO wait time
r/s	Reads per second
w/s	Writes per second

 %util near 100% = Disk bottleneck.

🔹 Check IO Wait (CPU waiting for disk)
top


Look at:

%wa


High value = Disk slow or overloaded.

🔹 Live Disk Activity
iotop


Shows process-wise disk usage.

Install if missing:

yum install iotop -y

🔹 Check Inode Usage

Sometimes disk shows free space but files cannot be created.

Check inode usage:

df -i


If inode usage = 100%, too many small files exist.

🔹 Log File Cleanup (Common Fix)

Check logs:

du -sh /var/log/*


Clear old logs safely:

truncate -s 0 /var/log/messages


(or configure log rotation using logrotate)

🛠 Troubleshooting Workflow (Real Admin Approach)

1️⃣ Check disk space
df -h

2️⃣ Identify large directories
du -sh * | sort -hr

3️⃣ Locate large files
find / -type f -size +500M

4️⃣ Check disk IO
iostat -x 1

5️⃣ Identify heavy processes
iotop

👨‍💻 Real Administrator Scenario

Example:

During a production alert, disk usage reached 95%.
Using df -h and du -sh, large log files were identified consuming disk space.
After cleaning old logs and enabling log rotation, disk utilization returned to normal and application performance improved.
